# Installation

Huf is a Frappe application. This guide covers installing it on your Frappe site, whether you're using Frappe Bench (self-hosted/local) or Frappe Cloud (managed hosting).

## Prerequisites

Before installing, you need a working Frappe site. If you're new to Frappe or don't have a site yet, visit the [Frappe Framework documentation](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/installation) to get started with Frappe first.

You should have:
- A Frappe site (Bench or Cloud)
- Terminal/console access to your site
- Python 3.8+ (usually already installed with Frappe)

**New to Frappe Bench?** Bench is the command-line tool for managing Frappe apps and sites. Think of it as a package manager for Frappe—it handles installation, updates, and management of multiple apps.

## Installation on Frappe Bench

For self-hosted or local Frappe setups using Bench:

### 1. Navigate to Bench Directory

```bash
cd /path/to/your/frappe-bench
```

Replace `/path/to/your/frappe-bench` with your actual Bench path (e.g., `~/frappe-bench`).

### 2. Get the App

Download Huf from GitHub:

```bash
bench get-app https://github.com/tridz-dev/agent_flo.git
```

This clones Huf into your `apps/` directory.

### 3. Install on Your Site

Install Huf on your site (replace `sitename` with your actual site name):

```bash
bench --site sitename install-app huf
```

### 4. Setup Dependencies

Huf requires LiteLLM and other Python packages. Install them:

```bash
bench setup requirements
```

### 5. Restart

```bash
bench restart
```

### 6. Verify

Log in to your Frappe site. Click the **App Switcher** (grid icon in the top-right) and look for **Huf** or **AgentFlo**. Click it to enter the Huf workspace.

## Installation on Frappe Cloud

Frappe Cloud is managed Frappe hosting. You can install Huf using the web interface or via console commands.

### Method 1: Using the Web Interface (Recommended)

Frappe Cloud provides a user-friendly interface for adding apps to your site.

#### 1. Access Marketplace

Log in to [frappecloud.com](https://frappecloud.com), navigate to your site, and open the **Marketplace** or **Apps** section. Click **Add Marketplace App** to open the app installation interface.

The marketplace shows available apps you can install. You can search for apps or add them directly from GitHub.

#### 2. Add from GitHub

Click the **Add from GitHub** button (highlighted in the top-right corner of the marketplace interface).

![Add app from GitHub modal](/images/add-from-github.png)

In the modal that appears:

1. Select the **"Public GitHub App"** tab (if not already selected)
2. Enter the GitHub URL: `https://github.com/tridz-dev/agent_flo`
3. Select the branch you want to install
4. The system will automatically detect the app as "Huf (huf)"
5. Click **Add App** to begin installation

The app will be automatically installed and configured on your site.

#### 3. Verify

After installation completes, refresh your site, open the **App Switcher**, and click **Huf** or **AgentFlo**.

### Method 2: Using Console Commands

Alternatively, you can install Huf using console commands:

#### 1. Access Console

Log in to [frappecloud.com](https://frappecloud.com), go to your site, and open the **Console** (terminal icon).

#### 2. Install

Run these commands in the console:

```bash
bench get-app https://github.com/tridz-dev/huf.git
bench --site $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME install-app huf
bench setup requirements
bench restart
```

> `$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME` is auto-set to your site name on Frappe Cloud.

#### 3. Verify

Refresh your site, open the **App Switcher**, and click **Huf**.

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify Huf is working:

1. **App Switcher** shows "Huf" or "AgentFlo"
2. You can open **AI Provider** from the Huf workspace
3. No error messages in the console

## Troubleshooting

**"Command not found: bench"**
- Bench is not installed or not in your PATH
- See [Frappe installation docs](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/installation)

**"App not found" or installation fails**
- Verify you're in the correct Bench directory
- Check your site name is correct: `bench --site sitename list-apps`
- Ensure internet connectivity (downloads from GitHub)
- Try `bench update` first to ensure Bench is current

**Dependencies not installing**
- Verify Python 3.8+ with `python3 --version`
- Ensure pip is available
- For dev environments, try `bench setup requirements --dev`

**LiteLLM errors**
- Huf requires LiteLLM for AI providers
- Run `bench setup requirements` again
- Restart with `bench restart`
- Check logs: `bench --site sitename console` then `import litellm`
