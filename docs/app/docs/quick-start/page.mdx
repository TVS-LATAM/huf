# Quick Start

**Get your first agent running in 5 minutes.** This guide walks you through creating a working AI agent that can interact with your Frappe data.

> **Already installed Huf?** Great! If not, check the [Installation](/docs/installation) guide first.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have a customer support agent that can:
- Answer questions about customer records
- Look up customer information on demand
- Respond naturally in conversation

## Step 1: Add an AI Provider

Providers connect Huf to AI services. You'll need an API key from one:

**1. Get an API Key**

Pick an AI provider and get your API key:
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) - GPT-4, GPT-3.5
- [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com) - Claude models
- [Google](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) - Gemini models
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) - Access to 500+ models

**2. Add Provider in Huf**

Navigate to: **Desk → Huf → AI Provider**

Click **New** and fill in:
- **Provider Name**: `OpenAI` (or your chosen provider)
- **API Key**: Paste your key here
- Click **Save**

> Your API key is encrypted and stored securely in Frappe.

## Step 2: Add an AI Model

Models are the "brains" behind your agent. Let's add one.

Navigate to: **Desk → Huf → AI Model**

Click **New** and fill in:
- **Model Name**: `gpt-4-turbo` (or `claude-3-opus`, `gemini-pro`, etc.)
- **Provider**: Select the provider you just created
- Click **Save**

> Use friendly names like `gpt-4-turbo`. Huf automatically formats them correctly for the provider.

## Step 3: Create Your Agent

Now for the fun part—creating your AI agent.

Navigate to: **Desk → Huf → Agent**

Click **New** and fill in:

**Basic Info**
- **Agent Name**: `Customer Support Assistant`
- **Provider**: Select your provider
- **Model**: Select your model

**Instructions**

Copy and paste this into the **Instructions** field:

```
You are a helpful customer support assistant. Your job is to help users find 
and understand customer information in the system. 

When asked about a customer:
1. Ask for the customer ID or name if not provided
2. Use the get_customer tool to retrieve their information
3. Present the information clearly and helpfully

Always be polite, professional, and concise. If you don't have a tool to do 
something, let the user know what you CAN help with instead.
```

**Settings**
- **Temperature**: `0.7` (balanced responses)
- **Top P**: `1.0`
- **Allow Chat**: Check this

**Save** the agent (we'll add tools next).

## Step 4: Give Your Agent a Tool

Tools let agents interact with your Frappe data. Let's give your agent the ability to look up customers.

**Create the Tool Function**

Navigate to: **Desk → Huf → Agent Tool Function**

Click **New** and fill in:
- **Tool Name**: `get_customer`
- **Description**: `Get detailed information about a customer by their ID or name`
- **Types**: Select `Get Document`
- **Reference DocType**: Select `Customer`
- Click **Save**

> The description is important—your agent uses it to decide when to use this tool.

**Add Tool to Agent**

Go back to your agent: **Desk → Huf → Agent → Customer Support Assistant**

Scroll to the **Agent Tool** table:
- Click **Add Row**
- **Tool Function**: Select `get_customer`
- **Save** the agent

Your agent now has the power to look up customer information!

## Step 5: Test Your Agent

Time to see it in action!

Navigate to: **Desk → Huf → Agent Chat**

Select your `Customer Support Assistant` from the dropdown.

**Try these prompts:**

```
Can you show me information about customer CUST-00001?
```

```
Tell me about the customer named "ABC Corporation"
```

```
What can you help me with?
```

You should see:
- The agent asks clarifying questions if needed
- The agent uses the `get_customer` tool to fetch data
- The agent presents information clearly

> **Behind the scenes**: Check **Agent Run** in the sidebar to see detailed logs of what happened—tokens used, tools called, costs, and more.

## You Did It!

You now have a working AI agent that can:
- Understand natural language
- Use tools to fetch Frappe data
- Respond intelligently to user questions

## What's Next?

### Learn Core Concepts
- **[Interfaces](/docs/concepts/interfaces)** - Understand `/huf` vs `/app` and when to use each
- **[Agents](/docs/concepts/agents)** - Dive deeper into agent configuration
- **[Tools](/docs/concepts/tools)** - Learn about all available tools
- **[Triggers](/docs/concepts/triggers)** - Make agents run automatically

### Expand Your Agent
- **Add more tools**: Create, update, delete documents

## Troubleshooting

**Agent not responding?**
- Verify API key has credits
- Check **Agent Run** for error messages
- Ensure model name matches your provider

**Tool not working?**
- Check you have permissions for the DocType
- Verify tool is added to agent's tool list
- Make sure Customer records exist in your site
