# Interfaces: Frontend vs Desk

Huf provides **two distinct interfaces** for interacting with AI agents. Understanding when to use each is key to getting the most out of Huf.

## Overview

| Interface | URL | Designed For | Use Case | Status |
|-----------|-----|--------------|----------|--------|
| **Frontend** | `/huf` | End users | Chat, interact with agents, view conversations | **Actively expanding** |
| **Desk** | `/app` | Administrators | Configure agents, manage providers, monitor all activity | **Complete** |

## Frontend Interface (`/huf`)

### What It Is

The **frontend** is a user-focused interface optimized for chatting with agents and viewing agent-related information without entering the Frappe Desk.

**Access**: Navigate to `https://your-site.com/huf`

### Who It's For

- **End users** who need to interact with agents
- **Non-admin users** who don't need full Frappe Desk access
- **Customer-facing** interactions (with proper permissions)

### Current Capabilities

**Available Now:**
- Real-time chat with agents
- View conversation history
- User-specific sessions

**Coming Soon:**
- Agent discovery/browsing
- Quick tool invocation
- Conversation management
- Mobile-optimized views
- Shared conversations
- User dashboards

### When to Use Frontend

Use `/huf` when you want to:
- Provide a clean, focused chat experience
- Give users access to agents without Frappe Desk training
- Build customer or team-facing agent interactions
- Keep the experience simple and uncluttered

### Current Limitations

The frontend is **under active development**. Right now:
- Limited to chat interactions
- No agent configuration (use Desk for this)
- Not all agent features are exposed yet

> **Roadmap**: The frontend is expanding rapidly. We're adding agent browsing, tool shortcuts, conversation management, and more. Check the GitHub repo for the latest updates.

## Desk Interface (`/app`)

### What It Is

The **Desk** is the full Frappe administration interface where you configure, manage, and monitor everything in Huf.

**Access**: Navigate to `https://your-site.com/app` → Switch to **Huf** workspace

### Who It's For

- **Administrators** setting up agents
- **Developers** creating custom tools
- **Operations teams** monitoring agent performance
- **Anyone** who needs full control and visibility

### Full Capabilities

**Configure:**
- Create and edit agents
- Set up AI providers and models
- Define agent tools and functions
- Configure triggers (schedule, doc events)
- Manage permissions

**Monitor:**
- Agent Run logs (every execution)
- Conversation history (all users)
- Token usage and costs
- Tool call details
- Error tracking

**Manage:**
- User permissions for agents
- Agent settings and defaults
- LiteLLM configuration
- Tool discovery cache

### When to Use Desk

Use `/app` (Desk) when you need to:
- Create or modify agents
- Add new AI providers or models
- Create custom tool functions
- Set up scheduled or event-driven agents
- Monitor agent performance and costs
- Debug issues or view detailed logs
- Configure system-wide settings

### DocTypes in Desk

Key DocTypes you'll work with:

| DocType | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Agent** | Define agents with instructions, models, tools |
| **AI Provider** | Store API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. |
| **AI Model** | Define which models are available |
| **Agent Tool Function** | Create tools agents can use |
| **Agent Trigger** | Schedule or event-based agent execution |
| **Agent Run** | View logs of every agent execution |
| **Agent Conversation** | View all conversation histories |
| **Agent Chat** | Real-time chat interface (also in Desk) |
| **Agent Settings** | System-wide defaults and configuration |

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Frontend (`/huf`) | Desk (`/app`) |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Chat with agents** | Primary use case | Via Agent Chat |
| **Create agents** | Not available | Full control |
| **Configure tools** | Not available | Full control |
| **View your conversations** | User-specific | All conversations |
| **Monitor agent runs** | Coming soon | Complete logs |
| **Manage providers** | Not available | Full control |
| **Set up triggers** | Not available | Full control |
| **Mobile optimized** | Coming soon | Desktop-first |
| **Permissions required** | User/Guest level | System Manager/custom |
| **User experience** | Clean, focused | Full admin power |

## Typical Workflows

### For End Users
1. Access `/huf` on desktop or mobile
2. Select or discover an agent to chat with
3. Interact naturally via chat
4. View conversation history
5. (Future) Quickly invoke common tools

### For Administrators
1. Access `/app` and switch to Huf workspace
2. Create agents, providers, models
3. Define tools and configure triggers
4. Test agents via Agent Chat in Desk
5. Monitor runs and costs
6. Iterate and improve based on logs

## Future Roadmap

### Frontend Expansion

We're actively building:
- **Agent Browser**: Discover and launch agents easily
- **Tool Shortcuts**: Quick access to common actions
- **Conversation Management**: Archive, search, export chats
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile experience
- **Public Agents**: Share agents externally (with permissions)
- **Voice Input**: Speak to agents directly
- **Rich Media**: Images, files, structured data in chat

### Desk Enhancements

Ongoing improvements:
- Better analytics and dashboards
- Advanced agent debugging tools
- Cost optimization recommendations
- A/B testing for agent prompts
- Version control for agents

## Best Practices

### For Organizations

- **Admin users**: Work exclusively in Desk to configure everything
- **End users**: Direct them to `/huf` for clean, focused interactions
- **Permissions**: Use Frappe's role-based permissions to control access
- **Training**: Train admins on Desk, end users only need `/huf`

### For Developers

- **Build custom tools** in Desk via Agent Tool Function
- **Test thoroughly** in Desk before exposing to frontend
- **Monitor logs** in Agent Run to debug issues
- **Iterate**: Use Agent Run insights to improve prompts and tools

## Security & Permissions

Both interfaces respect Frappe's permission system:

- **Frontend**: Users see only agents they have permission for
- **Desk**: Standard Frappe roles (System Manager, custom roles)
- **Agents**: Inherit the permissions of the user running them
- **Tools**: Execute with the current user's permissions

> **Important**: Agents always run with the permissions of the user who triggered them. An agent cannot access data the user doesn't have permission to see.

## What's Next?

Now that you understand the two interfaces:

- **[Agents](/docs/concepts/agents)** - Learn what agents are and how they work
- **[Providers & Models](/docs/concepts/providers-models)** - Connect to AI services
- **[Tools](/docs/concepts/tools)** - Give agents capabilities
- **[Quick Start](/docs/quick-start)** - Build your first agent (uses Desk)
